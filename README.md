## ABSTRACT

Abstract—
This paper presents a novel Python software project designed to streamline the process of data extraction and analysis. The project scope is limited to the extraction of structured data from web pages using Python's Beautiful Soup and Requests libraries. The software is designed to be user-friendly and easy to integrate with existing data analysis workflows.

The methodology employed in this project involves the use of Python's Requests library to send HTTP requests to target web pages, and the Beautiful Soup library to parse the resulting HTML content. The software is capable of identifying and extracting structured data from web pages using a combination of CSS selectors and XPath expressions.

Key technical features of the software include its ability to handle complex web page structures, support for multiple extraction methods, and compatibility with various data formats. The software is also designed to be extensible, allowing users to easily add new extraction methods or modify existing ones.

The software was tested on a variety of web pages with different structures and levels of complexity. The results indicate that the software is capable of accurately extracting structured data from a wide range of web pages, making it a valuable tool for data analysts and researchers.

In conclusion, this Python software project provides a powerful and flexible solution for data extraction and analysis. Its user-friendly interface, extensive documentation, and ease of integration make it an ideal tool for data analysts and researchers seeking to streamline their data extraction processes.
