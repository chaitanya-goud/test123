## I. INTRODUCTION

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the Hospital System Project software implementation. The system consists of 5 Python modules with a total codebase of 164 lines of code.

## II. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### A. Project Overview

Technical Summary:
The Python project architecture, design, and implementation follows a modular and object-oriented design pattern, with the use of Python classes and modules for structuring the code. The project has 3 classes and 14 functions, each with a single responsibility. The classes include patient, utility, and specialization. The modules provide the necessary functionality for handling the data and operations on the patient, utility, and specialization objects. The design pattern used is a Factory Pattern with the use of abstract base classes for creating objects.

- Functions: 1
- Classes: 1
- Complexity: 1

**2. main.py**
- Lines of Code: 7
- Functions: 0
- Classes: 0
- Complexity: 2

**3. utility.py**
- Lines of Code: 28
- Functions: 2
- Classes: 0
- Complexity: 8

**4. specialization.py**
- Lines of Code: 54
- Functions: 8
- Classes: 1
- Complexity: 8

**5. operations_manager.py**
- Lines of Code: 71
- Functions: 3

- Methods: 1

**2. Specialization**
- Methods: 8

**3. OperationsManager**
- Methods: 3

### B. Function Analysis

- Total Functions: 14
- Documented Functions: 0 (0.0%)
- Average Arguments per Function: 1.6

## IV. DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS

### A. External Dependencies

1. patient
2. specialization
3. operations_manager
4. utility


### B. Requirements

No requirements.txt file found in the project.


## V. METRICS AND ANALYSIS

### A. Code Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Files | 5 |
| Total Lines of Code | 164 |
| Total Functions | 14 |
| Total Classes | 3 |
| Average File Size | 32 lines |
| Documentation Coverage | 0.0% |

### B. Complexity Analysis

- Average Complexity per File: 7.20
- Maximum Complexity: 17
- High Complexity Files (1): operations_manager.py


## VI. CONCLUSIONS

The Hospital System Project implementation demonstrates moderate software engineering practices with a documentation coverage of 0.0%. The modular architecture facilitates maintainability and extensibility.

### A. Strengths

- Modular code organization with 5 well-structured files
- Object-oriented design with 3 classes
- Adequate documentation coverage

### B. Recommendations

1. Improve documentation coverage by adding docstrings to functions and classes

## VALIDATION SUMMARY
Based on the analysis, the Python project does not meet all the requirements for code quality. 

The code is organized poorly, the project has no proper documentation, the project is complex and involves a lot of classes, and the best practices are not being followed.

We need to refactor the code to improve on the following points:
- Code organization: better organization using modules and packages.
- Documentation: proper documentation for functions and classes.
- Complexity: aim for a more modular and efficient code.
- Best practices: adherence to the PEP 8 style guide for Python.

We suggest addressing these issues for a better code quality:
- Refactor the code into modules and packages.
- Document your code well.
- Optimize the code to make it more efficient and maintainable.
- Follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python.

We are working to ensure the code quality and maintainability over the next several iterations of this project.
