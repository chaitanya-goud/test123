## Abstract

mplementation of an operational hospital management system. The project's source code was subjected to a comprehensive examination using various metrics, including complexity scores, cyclomatic complexity, documentation coverage, and similarity scores between files.

The analysis revealed several key findings. Firstly, the average complexity score across all files is 13.40, indicating moderate levels of code complexity. Notably, file 3 (`specialization.py`) exhibits significantly higher complexity (26.0), suggesting potential areas requiring refactoring to improve maintainability. In contrast, file 1 (`main.py`) displays minimal complexity (1.0), underscoring its straightforward nature. The average cyclomatic complexity of 7.40 suggests that the codebase could benefit from further simplification.

Moreover, our analysis highlights a lack of documentation coverage across all files, with some methods lacking clear descriptions, as evident in files `patient.py` and `utility.py`. Furthermore, a comparison of similarity scores indicates varying degrees of cohesion among the code files, with `main.py` exhibiting the highest similarity score (0.625).

Our primary conclusion is that the Hospital System Project demonstrates room for improvement in terms of code organization, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. Recommendations include implementing docstrings to enhance understanding, refining complex modules like `specialization.py`, and promoting consistency in coding style throughout the project. By addressing these issues, developers can create more robust, scalable, and user-friendly hospital management systems.

## Introduction

** This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the Hospital System Project, a Python-based object-oriented programming (OOP) implementation, focusing on its code quality, structure, and adherence to best practices. The study aims to evaluate the system's maintainability, scalability, and reliability through metrics such as complexity scores, documentation coverage, and cyclomatic complexity.

**Introduction:**

The Hospital System Project is a Python-based OOP implementation designed to manage hospital patients, specializations, and their interactions. As part of our research, we conducted a thorough code analysis to assess its overall quality, identify potential issues, and provide recommendations for improvement. Our investigation aimed to answer the following research questions:

*   What are the code metrics and complexities associated with the Hospital System Project?
*   How effective is the use of OOP principles in the project?
*   Are there any areas that require improvement or optimization?

**Background and Motivation:**
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm that promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability through encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction (Gang of Four, 1994). In the context of software development, OOP enables developers to create complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable components. However, the adoption of OOP principles requires careful consideration of factors like complexity, coupling, and cohesion (Liskov et al., 1979).

**Objectives:**
This study aims to analyze the Hospital System Project based on the following objectives:

1.  Evaluate the project's code quality using metrics such as complexity scores, lines of code, and docstring coverage.
2.  Assess the effectiveness of OOP principles in the project, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
3.  Identify areas requiring improvement or optimization, such as redundant code, unnecessary complexity, and missing documentation.

**Scope of Analysis:**
Our analysis focuses on five files within the Hospital System Project: `main.py`, `patient.py`, `specialization.py`, `utility.py`, and `operations_manager.py`. We evaluated these files using metrics such as similarity score, functions, classes, complexity score, and lines of code. Specifically, we observed:

*   **main.py**: This file contains the entry point of the application, instantiating the `OperationsManager` class and calling its methods.
*   **patient.py**: This module defines the `Patient` class, which represents individual patients with attributes like name and status.
*   **specialization.py**: This file introduces the `Specialization` class, responsible for managing patients according to their specialization and priority.
*   **utility.py**: This module provides helper functions, including `input_is_valid` for validating user input and `generating_random_data` for simulating data generation.
*   **operations_manager.py**: This file implements the `OperationsManager` class, which orchestrates the entire system, providing options for adding patients, printing all patients, getting the next patient, removing a patient, and ending the program.

**Significance of the Work:**
This study contributes to the understanding of code quality and OOP principles in real-world applications. By analyzing the Hospital System Project, we aim to provide insights into the importance of code metrics, documentation, and best practices in software development. Our findings will help developers and researchers appreciate the value of maintaining high-quality code, adhering to industry-standard coding guidelines, and applying OOP principles effectively.

## Literature Review

the provided Python codebase. The focus is on code quality metrics, static analysis techniques, and software architecture principles.

**Code Quality Metrics**

The code quality metrics used in this study align with established guidelines such as those proposed by Halstead [1] and McCabe [2]. The total lines of code (LOC) and functions in the project are 137 and 14, respectively, indicating a moderate complexity level. The average cyclomatic complexity score of 7.40 suggests that the code has some nested control structures, which may lead to increased maintainability challenges [3].

The code's documentation coverage is reported at 0.0%, which indicates a lack of documentation in the analyzed files. This highlights the importance of incorporating documentation into the development process to improve understandability and maintainability [4].

**Static Analysis Techniques**

Static analysis techniques were employed to analyze the code's structure and identify potential issues. Similarity scores between files indicate that there are similarities between classes and methods across different files, suggesting potential duplication and opportunities for refactoring [5].

The Complexity Score of 1.0 for FILE 1 indicates a simple function without complex control flow or nesting. In contrast, FILE 3 has a high Complexity Score of 26.0 due to its long method chains and conditional statements.

**Software Architecture Principles**

The analyzed code adheres to object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, utilizing inheritance and polymorphism through the use of classes and objects [6]. However, the lack of interfaces and abstract classes limits the separation of concerns and flexibility in the design [7].

The code also demonstrates a clear separation of responsibilities among classes, with each class responsible for a specific functionality (e.g., `OperationsManager` handles user interactions, while `Specialization` manages patient queues).

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, this literature review highlights the importance of maintaining a balance between code simplicity, modularity, and documentation to ensure efficient maintenance and scalability. Future studies could investigate more advanced static analysis techniques and the application of design patterns to further optimize the code's structure.

## Results and Analysis

proximately 137 lines of code. The analysis aims to evaluate the code's quality, architecture, security, and documentation coverage.

**Quantitative Metrics**

Table 1: Quantitative Metrics

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Total Files | 5 |
| Total Lines of Code | 137 |
| Total Functions | 14 |
| Total Classes | 3 |
| Average Complexity | 13.40 |
| Average Cyclomatic Complexity | 7.40 |
| Documentation Coverage | 0.0% |

The total number of files is 5, indicating a relatively small project size. However, the average complexity score of 13.40 suggests that the code may contain some complex logic. The average cyclomatic complexity of 7.40 indicates a moderate level of decision-making within the code. Unfortunately, the documentation coverage is zero percent, suggesting a lack of documentation comments throughout the codebase.

**Code Quality Assessment**

The code quality assessment reveals several areas of improvement:

*   **Functionality**: The code appears to implement a hospital system with features like adding new patients, printing all patients, getting the next patient, and removing a leaving patient.
*   **Organization**: The code is organized into separate classes (`OperationsManager`, `Specialization`, and `Patient`) and functions (`input_is_valid` and `generating_random_data`).
*   **Naming Conventions**: The code follows consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes, adhering to Python's PEP 8 style guide.

However, there are opportunities for improvement:

*   **Comments and Docstrings**: As mentioned earlier, the documentation coverage is zero percent. Adding docstrings to functions and methods would improve readability and facilitate understanding of the code's functionality.
*   **Type Hints**: Some function parameters could benefit from type hints to enhance clarity and enable static type checking.
*   **Error Handling**: The code does not handle errors robustly; incorporating try-except blocks and proper error handling mechanisms would make it more resilient.

**Architectural Analysis**

The code exhibits a modular design, with each file containing a specific responsibility:

*   `main.py`: Serves as the entry point, instantiating the `OperationsManager` class and running its `run` method.
*   `patient.py`: Defines the `Patient` class with attributes like `name` and `status`.
*   `specialization.py`: Implements the `Specialization` class with methods for managing patients, such as `add_new_patient` and `get_next_patient`.
*   `utility.py`: Provides two helper functions: `input_is_valid` for validating user input and `generating_random_data` for populating the patient database.
*   `operations_manager.py`: Contains the `OperationsManager` class responsible for program flow control.

While the architecture seems sound, some suggestions for enhancement:

*   **Decoupling**: Consider decoupling the `OperationsManager` class from the `Specialization` class by using dependency injection or abstract interfaces.
*   **Separation of Concerns**: The `generating_random_data` function mixes business logic with data generation; consider separating these concerns into distinct modules.

**Security Findings**

No significant security vulnerabilities were identified during the analysis. However, the following observations suggest potential security considerations:

*   **Input Validation**: Although the `input_is_valid` function validates user input, it does not cover all edge cases (e.g., empty strings or extremely large inputs). Implementing more comprehensive validation checks can prevent potential security breaches.
*   **Data Storage**: The code stores sensitive information (patient data) without encryption or secure storage mechanisms. Implementing secure data storage practices will ensure confidentiality and integrity.

**Recommendations**

To improve the code quality and address the identified issues:

1.  Enhance documentation by adding docstrings to functions and methods.
2.  Incorporate type hints for function parameters.
3.  Implement robust error handling mechanisms.
4.  Decouple the `OperationsManager` class from the `Specialization` class.
5.  Separate concerns in the `generating_random_data` function.
6.  Validate user input comprehensively.
7.  Securely store patient data using encryption or other suitable means.

By addressing these recommendations, the codebase will become more maintainable, efficient, and secure.


## Discussion

ed Programming (OOP) project. The analysis aimed to evaluate the code's adherence to best practices, identify potential issues, and assess its overall quality.

The project consists of five files (`main.py`, `patient.py`, `specialization.py`, `utility.py`, and `operations_manager.py`), totaling 137 lines of code, with an average complexity score of 13.40 and cyclomatic complexity of 7.40. Notably, the documentation coverage is zero percent across all files, indicating a lack of explicit documentation.

Upon examining the code, several observations were made regarding adherence to best practices. Firstly, the use of similar function names across different classes (`add_new_patient` in `specialization.py` and `input_is_valid` in `utility.py`) suggests a lack of attention to naming conventions, which can lead to confusion and errors. It is recommended that unique and descriptive names be adopted to avoid such conflicts.

Another observation is the absence of docstrings in most functions, which is a crucial aspect of documenting code and facilitating understanding. According to PEP 257, docstrings provide a description of what a function does, its parameters, and any exceptions it may raise. Including docstrings would enhance the maintainability and readability of the code.

Furthermore, the high cyclomatic complexity scores of 26.0 in `specialization.py` and 25.0 in `operations_manager.py` indicate complex decision-making logic within these classes. While some complexity is unavoidable, excessive nesting and conditional statements can make the code harder to comprehend and debug. It is suggested that refactoring techniques, such as breaking down long methods into smaller ones, could simplify the code and improve its maintainability.

In terms of design patterns, the project employs object-oriented principles, utilizing inheritance and polymorphism effectively. However, the `Patient` class lacks clear encapsulation, as its attributes are directly accessed and modified outside the class. Encapsulation helps conceal internal implementation details, reducing coupling between objects.

The similarity scores among the files suggest a moderate level of reuse, but the actual instances of shared functionality are limited. This could be improved by implementing more robust abstractions and interfaces to promote modularity and flexibility.

Lastly, the project's reliance on global variables and mutable state raises concerns about thread safety and concurrent execution. In a multi-threaded environment, accessing shared data can result in unexpected behavior. To mitigate this risk, consider using immutable data structures or employing synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread-safety.

In conclusion, while the project demonstrates some good OOP principles, there are areas for improvement regarding best practices, documentation, complexity, and design patterns. Addressing these concerns will contribute to enhanced code quality, maintainability, and scalability.

**Recommendations:**

1.  Improve naming conventions to minimize naming conflicts.
2.  Incorporate docstrings to facilitate understanding and documentation.
3.  Simplify complex logic by refactoring methods and reducing cyclomatic complexity.
4.  Enhance encapsulation in the `Patient` class.
5.  Implement robust abstractions and interfaces for better modularity.
6.  Consider using immutable data structures and synchronization mechanisms for thread-safe execution.

By addressing these recommendations, the Hospital System Project can become more maintainable, efficient, and scalable, ultimately leading to a higher-quality software product.


## Recommendations

, and performance:

### I. Refactoring Suggestions (High Impact, High Feasibility)

1.  **Improve Code Organization**: The current project structure appears to be a collection of loosely related scripts. We suggest reorganizing the project into modules or packages based on their functional responsibilities to improve modularity and ease maintenance.
    *   Reference: `/kaggle/input/oop-project/Python_OOP_Projects-main/Hospital System Project/main.py`, `/kaggle/input/oop-project/Python_OOP_Projects-main/Hospital System Project/patient.py`, etc.
2.  **Enhance Functionality Encapsulation**: Some functions, such as `input_is_valid` and `generating_random_data`, seem to belong to specific classes or modules rather than being global utilities. Consider moving them to their respective contexts.
    *   Reference: `/kaggle/input/oop-project/Python_OOP_Projects-main/Hospital System Project/utility.py`
3.  **Simplify Conditional Statements**: Certain conditions in the code can be simplified using early returns or more concise logical expressions.
    *   Example: In `add_new_patient` method of `specialization.py`, instead of multiple `return` statements, consider simplifying the conditionals using early returns.

### II. Security Improvements (Medium Impact, Medium Feasibility)

1.  **Input Validation**: While `input_is_valid` function provides basic validation, it only checks for decimal inputs. We recommend adding additional checks for non-numeric inputs and potential exceptions during parsing.
    *   Reference: `/kaggle/input/oop-project/Python_OOP_Projects-main/Hospital System Project/utility.py`
2.  **Error Handling**: Implement try-except blocks to catch and handle potential exceptions that may occur during execution, providing informative error messages where necessary.
    *   Example: In `run` method of `OperationsManager` class, consider wrapping the user input processing within a try-except block.

### III. Performance Optimizations (Low Impact, Low Feasibility)

1.  **List Iteration**: In `generating_random_data` function, consider using list comprehensions or generator expressions to create lists instead of appending individual elements iteratively.
    *   Reference: `/kaggle/input/oop-project/Python_OOP_Projects-main/Hospital System Project/utility.py`

### IV. Best Practices (High Impact, High Feasibility)

1.  **Documentation**: Ensure consistent docstrings for functions and classes to provide clear descriptions of their purpose, parameters, and behavior.
    *   Reference: All files (`*.py`)
2.  **Type Hints**: Use type hints for function parameters and return types to improve readability and facilitate static type checking.
    *   Example: In `print_menu` method of `OperationsManager` class, consider adding type hints for the returned value.

By addressing these recommendations, the code will become more maintainable, secure, and efficient, ultimately leading to better overall quality and scalability.


## Conclusion

ed Programming (OOP) project consisting of five files with a total of 137 lines of code. The analysis aimed to evaluate the project's maintainability, understandability, and adherence to good coding practices.

**Summary of Major Findings**

The project exhibits moderate complexity, with an average complexity score of 13.40 and an average cyclomatic complexity of 7.40. While the project demonstrates some structural organization through the use of classes and functions, there are areas that require improvement, such as inconsistent docstring coverage across the analyzed files. Specifically, none of the files have any docstrings, which makes it challenging for developers to comprehend the functionality of the code without delving into its implementation.

Notably, the `operations_manager.py` file, which serves as the entry point of the application, has a high complexity score of 25.0 due to its extensive use of conditional statements and function calls. In contrast, the `patient.py` file, containing the `Patient` class, has a relatively low complexity score of 5.0, indicating a more straightforward implementation.

**Achievement of Objectives**

Despite some limitations, the project has achieved its primary objective of providing a functional hospital management system. The code is organized around classes and methods, demonstrating a basic understanding of OOP principles. However, further improvements can be made to enhance maintainability, readability, and scalability.

**Future Work Suggestions**

To improve the overall quality of the project, we recommend the following:

1.  **Improve Docstring Coverage**: Ensure that all functions and classes are accompanied by clear and concise docstrings, providing essential information about their purpose, parameters, and return values.
2.  **Reduce Complexity**: Simplify complex logic in the `operations_manager.py` file by breaking down long conditional statements and utilizing more descriptive variable names.
3.  **Increase Modularity**: Consider introducing separate modules or packages for each feature or component of the hospital management system, promoting better modularity and reusability.
4.  **Enhance Testing**: Implement unit tests and integration tests to verify the correctness and robustness of the code, ensuring that changes do not introduce bugs or break existing functionality.

By addressing these recommendations, the project can become more maintainable, readable, and scalable, ultimately leading to improved performance and reliability in real-world applications.

**Recommendations for Future Development**

We suggest continuing to develop the project using best practices and design patterns, such as the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, to ensure a clean separation of concerns and promote a more modular architecture. Additionally, incorporating testing frameworks like Pytest or Unittest will facilitate the development of thorough unit tests and integration tests.

In conclusion, our analysis provides valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the Hospital System Project, highlighting opportunities for improvement and growth. By addressing the identified issues and incorporating recommended best practices, the project can evolve into a more robust, maintainable, and effective solution for managing hospital data.
