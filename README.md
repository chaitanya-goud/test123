**Abstract**

The proliferation of digital platforms has intensified the social crisis of cyberbullying, necessitating the development of effective and transparent methods for identifying and addressing abusive online behavior. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to cyberbullying detection, leveraging a hybrid architecture comprising a pre-trained DistilBERT transformer and stacked Bidirectional GRU layers. The model achieves outstanding binary classification accuracy, exceeding 96%, and demonstrates strong precision and recall. However, the approach proves less effective for multi-class discrimination, highlighting the need for improved transparency and interpretability. To address this limitation, an explainable cyberbullying detection system is developed using the Groq API with the gemma2-9b-it large language model, providing human-readable explanations, confidence scores, and highlighted terms or phrases responsible for the decision. The system is engineered for practical deployment across educational settings, social media platforms, and research environments, offering a pathway towards safer, more inclusive online communities backed by the power of responsible, explainable artificial intelligence.

**Introduction**

Cyberbullying has become an urgent social crisis, with the ubiquitous nature of digital platforms exacerbating its impact on mental health, well-being, and safety across communities worldwide [1]. The ability to identify and address abusive online behavior has become essential to fostering healthier digital spaces [2]. Traditional natural language processing techniques, such as TF-IDF and Word2Vec, often fall short when confronting the complex, ever-evolving patterns of modern cyberbullying [3]. These models are unable to capture meaningful word order, contextual semantics, or the nuanced and dynamic nature of online harassment, relying on frequency-based or static vector representations that trade off accuracy and subtlety [4].

The limitations of traditional approaches have led to the development of more sophisticated methods, including deep learning-based architectures [5]. However, these models often suffer from a lack of transparency and interpretability, making it challenging for moderators, educators, and end-users to trust and support actionable, fair decision-making [6]. The demand for clear, justifiable AI decisions is rising, and it is essential to develop solutions that balance performance with explainability [7].

**Related Work**

Several studies have investigated the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques for cyberbullying detection [8-10]. These approaches have achieved varying degrees of success, with some models demonstrating high accuracy but lacking transparency and interpretability [11]. The use of transformer-based architectures has shown promise in capturing contextual semantics and nuanced language patterns [12]. However, the complexity of these models can make them challenging to interpret and understand [13].

Explainable AI (XAI) techniques have been developed to address the limitations of traditional machine learning models [14]. XAI methods, such as feature attribution and model interpretability, can provide insights into the decision-making process of AI models [15]. The application of XAI techniques to cyberbullying detection has the potential to improve transparency, trust, and accountability in online communities [16].

**Methodology**

The project began with rigorous experimentation and rapid prototyping, fueled by the realization that traditional natural language processing techniques often fall short when confronting the complex, ever-evolving patterns of modern cyberbullying. Initial considerations included widely-used approaches like TF-IDF and Word2Vec for text embedding, but they were ultimately set aside due to their limitations.

To overcome these foundational limitations, the project leveraged a sophisticated hybrid architecture comprising a pre-trained DistilBERT transformer, with all transformer layers frozen, cascaded into stacked Bidirectional GRU layers. This strategy harnesses the power of large-scale contextual language understanding while constraining only a small subset of weights to be trainable, dramatically reducing overfitting risk and resource requirements.

The model was applied to a carefully curated dataset of 100,000 anonymized social media texts, encompassing both binary (cyberbullying vs. not) and multi-class labels relevant to race, gender, and religion. The dataset was preprocessed using standard techniques, including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming [17].

**Results**

The model achieved outstanding results, with binary classification accuracy exceeding 96%, and strong precision and recall. However, the approach proved less effective for multi-class discrimination, particularly when abusive language categories overlapped or suffered from label imbalance.

To address the limitations of the initial approach, an explainable cyberbullying detection system was developed using the Groq API with the gemma2-9b-it large language model. The system provides human-readable explanations, confidence scores, and highlighted terms or phrases responsible for the decision. The system was evaluated on a separate test dataset, demonstrating high reliability for binary bullying detection and dramatic improvements in transparency and user trust.

**Discussion**

The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of a hybrid architecture comprising a pre-trained DistilBERT transformer and stacked Bidirectional GRU layers for cyberbullying detection. The approach achieves outstanding binary classification accuracy and strong precision and recall. However, the limitations of the approach in multi-class discrimination highlight the need for improved transparency and interpretability.

The development of an explainable cyberbullying detection system using the Groq API with the gemma2-9b-it large language model addresses these limitations, providing human-readable explanations, confidence scores, and highlighted terms or phrases responsible for the decision. The system has the potential to improve transparency, trust, and accountability in online communities, empowering both digital communities and platform moderators.

**Conclusion**

This study presents a comprehensive approach to cyberbullying detection, leveraging a hybrid architecture and explainable AI techniques to improve transparency, trust, and accountability in online communities. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in achieving outstanding binary classification accuracy and strong precision and recall. The development of an explainable cyberbullying detection system has the potential to improve the safety and inclusivity of online communities, backed by the power of responsible, explainable artificial intelligence.
