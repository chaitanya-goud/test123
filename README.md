## Abstract

oyee records. The analyzed codebase consists of five files with a total of 92 lines of code, 13 functions, and 3 classes. Our investigation aimed to assess the code's structure, complexity, and adherence to best practices.

The analysis revealed that the average cyclomatic complexity of the codebase is 4.8, indicating moderate complexity. However, one file (EmployeesManager.py) exhibits a high cyclomatic complexity score of 22.0, suggesting potential issues with maintainability and scalability. Furthermore, the documentation coverage across all files is remarkably low at 0.0%, highlighting the need for improved documentation.

Our examination of individual files reveals interesting insights. For instance, Main.py relies heavily on the FrontendManager class, demonstrating a clear separation of concerns between presentation logic and business logic. In contrast, Employee.py defines a simple Employee class with basic attributes and methods, showcasing the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming. EmployeesManager.py, on the other hand, displays a more complex design, utilizing multiple methods to interact with the Employee class.

Notably, the utility module (utility.py) provides a reusable function, input_is_valid, which ensures user input validation across the entire application. However, this approach raises questions regarding the consistency of input handling throughout the codebase.

Based on our findings, we conclude that while the code demonstrates some good practices, such as separation of concerns and reusability, it also suffers from significant shortcomings, including high complexity, poor documentation, and inconsistent input handling. We recommend addressing these issues through refactoring, improved documentation, and enhanced testing to ensure the long-term maintainability and reliability of the system.


## Introduction

report presents an in-depth analysis of a Python project implementing object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, focusing on its code structure, complexity, and documentation quality. The project's five files, comprising approximately 92 lines of code, were evaluated using metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, similarity scores, and docstring coverage. Our findings highlight areas where improvements can be made to enhance maintainability, readability, and scalability.

**Introduction**

The increasing adoption of object-oriented programming (OOP) in software development emphasizes the importance of designing robust, modular, and efficient systems. However, without thorough analysis and evaluation, OOP projects may suffer from complexities that hinder their overall quality and maintainability [1]. This report presents a comprehensive code analysis of a Python project, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses, with a focus on improving software engineering practices.

The analyzed project consists of five files, totaling 92 lines of code, with three classes (`Employee`, `EmployeesManager`, and `FrontendManager`) and thirteen functions. Upon initial inspection, we observe that the project demonstrates basic OOP principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. However, upon closer examination, several issues become apparent. Specifically, the average cyclomatic complexity (4.8) indicates a moderate level of complexity, which might lead to difficulties in understanding and modifying the codebase [2].

A key finding is the lack of documentation coverage (0.0%) across all files, indicating inadequate commenting and explanation of code logic, functions, and class methods. This deficiency makes it challenging for developers to comprehend and extend the codebase effectively. Furthermore, some functions and classes exhibit high cyclomatic complexity scores, suggesting potential performance bottlenecks or difficulty in debugging [3].

Notably, the `EmployeesManager` class displays a higher complexity score (22.0) compared to other classes, possibly due to the presence of multiple conditional statements and loops within its methods. In contrast, the `utility` module appears relatively straightforward, with a lower complexity score (6.0), showcasing the benefits of concise coding practices.

This analysis aims to address the following research questions:

1. What are the primary design patterns and structures employed in the project?
2. How does the project's complexity impact its maintainability and scalability?
3. Are there opportunities for improvement in terms of documentation and code organization?

By addressing these questions, this study provides actionable insights for the developer community to refine their coding practices, ensuring more maintainable, readable, and scalable software systems.

## Analysis

g its structure, quality, and adherence to design principles.

**I. Architectural Patterns**

The codebase employs a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, where each module serves as either a model (e.g., `EmployeesManager`), view (e.g., `FrontendManager`), or controller (e.g., `Main`). This separation of concerns facilitates maintainability and scalability. However, some modules, such as `utility.py`, lack clear categorization under this pattern.

Specifically, `EmployeesManager` acts as both a model and controller, handling business logic and user interactions. The `FrontendManager` class, on the other hand, serves as a controller, coordinating user inputs and actions. While this division of responsibilities generally adheres to MVC principles, it would be beneficial to further separate these concerns into distinct classes or functions for improved clarity and modularity.

**II. Code Organization**

The codebase consists of five files, each containing a single class or set of related functions. This organizational approach allows for easy navigation and understanding of individual components. However, there is no explicit package structure, which may lead to difficulties in managing dependencies between modules.

To improve organization, consider introducing packages or subdirectories to group related classes and functions logically. For example, creating a separate package for utilities (`utils`) could house the `input_is_valid` function, making it easily accessible throughout the project.

**III. Design Principles Adherence**

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The codebase largely follows SRP, with each class having a single responsibility (e.g., `EmployeesManager` manages employee data). However, some methods within classes perform multiple tasks (e.g., `FrontendManager`'s `run` method handles user input and interacts with the `EmployeesManager`). To adhere more closely to SRP, consider refactoring these methods into smaller, more focused functions.

### Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

The codebase does not explicitly demonstrate OCP, which suggests that new functionality should be added without modifying existing code. In fact, several classes and functions appear to have rigid structures that might require modifications to accommodate new requirements. Implementing interfaces, abstract classes, or decorators can help achieve OCP compliance.

### Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

The code contains instances of duplicated logic, such as the repeated use of `input()` calls in various modules. Applying the DRY principle can reduce redundancy by extracting common functionality into reusable functions or methods.

**IV. Quality and Maintainability**

The provided codebase exhibits several issues affecting quality and maintainability:

*   **Documentation**: There are no docstrings or comments explaining the purpose, parameters, and behavior of functions or methods. Adding documentation will improve understandability and facilitate future maintenance.
*   **Error Handling**: Some functions do not handle potential errors or edge cases effectively, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. Implementing try-except blocks and validating user inputs can mitigate these issues.
*   **Testing**: Although not present in the provided code, incorporating unit tests and integration tests will ensure the correctness and robustness of the implemented features.

In conclusion, the codebase demonstrates good intentions toward adhering to architectural patterns, but areas for improvement exist regarding organization, design principles, and quality. By addressing these suggestions, the codebase will become more maintainable, scalable, and reliable.

**Recommendations for Future Development**

1.  Organize the code into logical packages and subdirectories.
2.  Apply design principles (SRP, OCP, DRY) through refactoring and encapsulation.
3.  Improve documentation and error handling.
4.  Introduce testing frameworks to verify the correctness of the implementation.

By implementing these recommendations, the codebase will become more maintainable, scalable, and reliable, ultimately providing a solid foundation for future development.


## Recommendations

em. The following recommendations prioritize high-impact and feasible suggestions:

### I. Refactoring Suggestions (High Impact)

1.  **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Enforce PEP 8 naming conventions throughout the project. For instance, `input_is_valid` should be renamed to `validate_input`.
    *   Reference: `/kaggle/input/oop-project/Python_OOP_Projects-main/Employees System Project/utility.py`
2.  **Improve Code Organization**: Consider grouping related functions within classes or modules to enhance modularity and reusability. This can be achieved by moving the `add_employee`, `list_employee`, and other similar methods into the `EmployeesManager` class.
    *   Reference: `/kaggle/input/oop-project/Python_OOP_Projects-main/Employees System Project/EmployeesManager.py`
3.  **Simplify Conditional Statements**: Reduce nesting complexity by simplifying conditional statements using early returns or avoiding unnecessary checks.
    *   Example: In `EmployeesManager.delete_employees_with_age`, consider early returning instead of printing a message after deletion.
    *   Reference: `/kaggle/input/oop-project/Python_OOP_Projects-main/Employees System Project/EmployeesManager.py`

### II. Security Improvements (Medium Impact)

1.  **Input Validation**: Enhance input validation in `input_is_valid` to handle non-integer inputs more robustly. Currently, it only checks for decimal values; consider adding checks for negative numbers and non-numeric characters.
    *   Reference: `/kaggle/input/oop-project/Python_OOP_Projects-main/Employees System Project/utility.py`
2.  **Error Handling**: Implement try-except blocks to catch potential exceptions during user input, ensuring the program doesn't crash unexpectedly.
    *   Reference: Throughout the codebase, especially in `FrontendManager.run()`

### III. Performance Optimizations (Low-Medium Impact)

1.  **Avoid Global Variables**: Minimize global variable usage by encapsulating them within classes or functions. In this case, consider moving `app` in `Main.py` into the `FrontendManager` class.
    *   Reference: `/kaggle/input/oop-project/Python_OOP_Projects-main/Employees System Project/Main.py`
2.  **Lazy Loading**: Consider lazy loading techniques to delay object creation until necessary, reducing memory consumption and improving performance.
    *   Reference: Evaluate opportunities for lazy loading in `EmployeesManager` and other classes

### IV. Best Practices (Low Impact)

1.  **Documentation**: Ensure that docstrings accompany all public functions and classes, adhering to the Google style guide.
    *   References: Throughout the codebase
2.  **Type Hints**: Use type hints for function parameters and return types to improve code readability and facilitate static analysis tools.
    *   Examples: Add type hints in `FrontendManager.print_menu()` and other functions

By implementing these recommendations, the code will become more maintainable, secure, and efficient, ultimately leading to improved overall quality and reliability.


## Conclusion

nd totaling approximately 92 lines of code. The analysis aimed to evaluate the code's complexity, documentation coverage, and adherence to good practices.

The key findings of this study can be summarized as follows:

*   **High average complexity**: The project exhibits high average complexity, with an overall score of 10.40, indicating a moderate to high level of complexity. This may suggest that the code requires further refactoring or modularization to improve maintainability and readability.
*   **Low documentation coverage**: A staggering 0.0% docstring coverage indicates that the code lacks adequate documentation, making it challenging for developers to understand the functionality and intent behind each module.
